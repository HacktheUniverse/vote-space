*Vote Space*

This is a web application which finds your congressional representatives, and grades them based on their voting history with space related legislation.

We aggregate live data from [Sunlight Labs' Congress API](https://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/) to find space related bills, map those to voting records, and pick out the voting records for your representatives according to your zip code.

Please view our project in the latest version of Chrome.
